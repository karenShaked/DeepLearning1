In this Python-based neural network assignment systematically explore various
model architectures by manipulating layers, lengths, activation functions, and loss
functions. Through this process, we observed and analysed the distinct impacts of
these choices on the model's performance.
Additionally, we ensured the accuracy of our models through verification tests,
including the Gradient Test and Jacobian Test.
As we observed how the model preforms on all given data files, the graphs in here
are based on 'GMMData.mat' file where input features and labels dimensions are
both 5.
